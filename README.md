# Cuisine-Clustering
A clustering script that is  capable of grouping un-labeled recipes respective of their ingredients. Currently works best for 3 clusters:
Sweet recipes/Deserts
Spiced/Oriental food
Savoury, 'plain' meals e.g pizza, pie, mashed potato

Should I find the time I would like to see how the same script performs at clustering an individual cluster.
I.e can it separate the seasoned foods into Thai, Japanese, Chinese etc
